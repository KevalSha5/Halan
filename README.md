### Setting Up ###

1) Get Node.js  
2) Open command line prompt in project directory  
3) Run 'npm install --save discord.js' to get required modules  
4) Run the bot with 'node bot.js'  

## Important to Note ##
The token in config.json is supposed to be super secretive. It basically Discord tells which bot you are.  

## Running your own bot ##
1) Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.  
2) Go through the steps of creating a new application  
   [Find in-depth guide here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)  
3) Replace the token with your own token and run it.
